# Septimus - Hardcore Addon

[Changelog](https://github.com/Ender108/SeptimusHardcoreAddon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

[Link to Septimus README](https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/septimus/blob/main/README.md)

This is an optional addon for GuitarNinja's Septimus modlist that will greatly increase the difficulty.

Works with the current 1.6.1 version of Septimus.

This addon requires a **NEW SAVE**. It will not work properly if you install it mid-playthrough of base Septimus.
