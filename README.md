# Dragonborn - Hardcore Addon
This is an optional addon for GuitarNinja's Dragonborn modlist that will greatly increase the difficulty.



## Mod Installation
Create a new separator and name it **[NoDelete] Dragonborn - Hardcore Addon**. Place it under the **THE DANGER ZONE** separator. Install all the mods below in top to bottom order.

1.) [No Saving in Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29914) is a very simple mod that, you guessed it, disables saving in combat.
  - Download and install the main file and rename it to **[NoDelete] No Saving in Combat**.

2.) [No Killmoves - No Killcams - No Killbites](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13395) disables melee finishing moves, ranged/magic slow-motion kills, and dragon bite-and-throw attacks. The goal is to have more intense fights with less cheap deaths.
  - Download and install the main file and rename it to **[NoDelete] No Killmoves - No Killcams - No Killbites**.

3.) [Survival Mode Prompt Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59049) will remove the survival mode prompt and enable it by default.
  - Download and install the "Survival Mode - Enable By Default" main file and rename it to **[NoDelete] Survival Mode - Enable By Default**.

4.) [Locational Encounter Zones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85212) is a SKSE plugin which makes enemies guarding a location the same level as the ones inside.
  - Download and install the main file and rename it to **[NoDelete] Locational Encounter Zones**.

5.) [King-Priest - Enhanced Dragon Priests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59652) makes encounters with Dragon Priests a much more challenging experience balanced for high-level play. 
  - Download and install the main file and rename it to **[NoDelete] King-Priest - Enhanced Dragon Priests**
  - Download and install the two optional files and rename them to **[NoDelete] King-Priest - Abyss Add-On** and **[NoDelete] King-Priest - Wyrmstooth Patch**

x.) Dragonborn - Hardcore Uncapper INI caps the max level to 50 and does not grant any carry weight bonus on level up. This will encourage the player to put some thought into selecting perks and to rely heavily on equipment, spells, and enchantments to increase their carry weight.
