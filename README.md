Create a new separator and name it **[NoDelete] Dragonborn - Hardcore Addon**. Place it under the **THE DANGER ZONE** separator.

- [No Saving in Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29914) is a very simple mod that, you guessed it, disables saving in combat.
  - Download and install the main file and rename it to **[NoDelete] No Saving in Combat**

- [No Killmoves - No Killcams - No Killbites](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13395) disables melee finishing moves, ranged/magic slow-motion kills, and dragon bite-and-throw attacks. The goal is to have more intense fights with less cheap deaths.
